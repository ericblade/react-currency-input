## Use

- `npm install` to install everything
- Open the interactive Component Testing runner with `npx cypress open-ct`
- Run all the specs with `npx cypress run-ct` (include `--headed` to see the UI)

## How it works

- Uses webpack dev server to automatically update and re-run your tests when you save
